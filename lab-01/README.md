# Lab 01 - Creating an app from a Docker image

In this lab you will learn how to create a new project on OpenShift and how to
create an application from an existing docker image.

## Task 1: Create a new project from command line

We will first exporting your username as a variable, that way it will be easy to
just copy/paste the commands below.

```
export USER_NAME=<REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_USER_NAME>
```

Make sure that you have exported your username correctly:

```
echo ${USER_NAME}

---

user04
```

If your username is not echoed correctly, you probably made a mistake with the 
previous `export` command, so try that command again.

The command below creates a new project and is setting a description and display
name for the project.

```
oc new-project lab-01-${USER_NAME} --description="lab-01 - ${USER_NAME}" --display-name="lab-01 - ${USER_NAME}"

---

Now using project "lab-01-user13" on server "https://openshift-workshop.gluo.io:8443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app centos/ruby-25-centos7~https://github.com/sclorg/ruby-ex.git

to build a new example application in Ruby.
```

Upon project creation, OpenShift will automatically switch to the newly created
project/namespace. If you wish to view the list of projects, run the following
command:

```
oc get projects
```

If you have more than one project, you can switch to a different one by issuing
`oc project <project name>`. Although you donâ€™t want to do it now.

You can also check the status of the project by running the following command.
It says that the project is currently not running anything.

```
oc status

In project lab-01 - <USER_NAME> (lab-01-<USER_NAME>) on server https://openshift-workshop.gluo.io:8443

You have no services, deployment configs, or build configs.
Run 'oc new-app' to create an application.
```

## Task 2: Create an app from a Docker image

Next we will create an application inside the above project using an existing
docker image. We will be using a very simple Docker image from Docker Hub that
just says 'Welcome to OpenShift V3. Let us just use that for this exercise.

First create a new application using the docker image using the `oc new-app`
command as shown below:

```
oc new-app gluobe/welcome-php --name=welcome

---

--> Found Docker image 616b725 (2 years old) from Docker Hub for "gluobe/welcome-php"

    chx/welcome-php-1:b68a2d86
    --------------------------
    Platform for building and running PHP 5.6 applications

    Tags: builder, php, php56, rh-php56

    * An image stream tag will be created as "welcome:latest" that will track this image
    * This image will be deployed in deployment config "welcome"
    * Port 8080/tcp will be load balanced by service "welcome"
      * Other containers can access this service through the hostname "welcome"

--> Creating resources ...
    imagestream.image.openshift.io "welcome" created
    deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "welcome" created
    service "welcome" created
--> Success
    Application is not exposed. You can expose services to the outside world by executing one or more of the commands below:
     'oc expose svc/welcome'
    Run 'oc status' to view your app.
```

The above command uses the docker image to deploy a docker container in a pod.
If you quickly run `oc get pods` you will notice that a deployer pod runs and it
starts an application pod as shown below.

```
oc get pods

---

NAME               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-deploy   1/1       Running   0          1m
welcome-1-dkyyq    0/1       Pending   0          0s
```

In the above example `welcome-1-deploy` is the deployer pod and the other one is
the actual application pod. In a little while the deployer pod will succeed and
the application pod will change for `Pending` to `Running` status.

```
oc get pods

---

NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
welcome-1-dkyyq   1/1       Running   0          56s
```

## Task 3: Add a route for your app

OpenShift also spins up a service for this application. Run the following
command to view the list of services in the project (you can also use
`oc get svc` shorthand).

```
oc get services

---

NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
welcome   172.30.77.93   <none>        8080/TCP   2m
```

You will notice the `welcome` service was created for this project.

However, there is no route for this application yet. So you cannot access this
application from outside.

Now add a route to the service with the following command. `oc expose` command
will allow you to expose your service to the world so that you can access it
from the browser.

*Note*: In this example, I am using a domain name of
`apps.openshift-workshop.gluo.io`.

```
oc expose service welcome --name=welcome

---

route.route.openshift.io/welcome exposed
```

With the `oc get routes` commad very that the route has been created:

```
oc get routes

---

NAME      HOST/PORT                                               PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
welcome   welcome-lab-01-<USER_NAME>.apps.openshift-workshop.gluo.io             welcome    8080-tcp                 None
```

## Task 4: Test your app

From the `oc get routes` copy the host and surf to it from your browser:
http://welcome-lab-01-<USER_NAME>.apps.openshift-workshop.gluo.io

Voila!! you created your first application using an existing docker image on
OpenShift.

## Task 5: Clean up

Run the `oc get all` command to view all the components that were created in
your project.

```
oc get all

---

NAME                  READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pod/welcome-1-8gwxj   1/1       Running   0          4m

NAME                              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
replicationcontroller/welcome-1   1         1         1         4m

NAME              TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
service/welcome   ClusterIP   172.30.136.19   <none>        8080/TCP   4m

NAME                                         REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io/welcome   1          1         1         config,image(welcome:latest)

NAME                                     DOCKER REPO                                             TAGS      UPDATED
imagestream.image.openshift.io/welcome   docker-registry.default.svc:5000/labs-trescst/welcome   latest    4 minutes ago

NAME                               HOST/PORT                                                       PATH      SERVICES   PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
route.route.openshift.io/welcome   welcome-labs-trescst.7e14.starter-us-west-2.openshiftapps.com             welcome    8080-tcp                 None
```

Now you can delete all these components by running one command.

```
oc delete all --all

pod "welcome-1-8gwxj" deleted
replicationcontroller "welcome-1" deleted
service "welcome" deleted
deploymentconfig.apps.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
imagestream.image.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
route.route.openshift.io "welcome" deleted
```

You will notice that it has deleted the imagestream for the application, the
deploymentconfig, the service and the route.

You can run `oc get all` again to make sure the project is empty.

```
oc get all

---

No resources found.
```

Congratulations!! You now know how to create a project, an application using an
external docker image and navigate around. Get ready for more fun stuff!

Delete the project with the following command.

```
oc delete project lab-01-${USER_NAME}

---

project.project.openshift.io "lab-01-user13" deleted
```
